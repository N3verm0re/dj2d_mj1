  description: A band of "men of science" has approached the council with a proposal.
    They will work free to combat disease if you let them work with their own methods.
    They seem fairly rudimentary in their approach to medicine and the people are
    scared of their appearance but their results are undeniable. Do you accept their
    offer?
